<h1>Mission: Survive</h1>
<p>Mission: Survive is a space shooter style game which is a sci-fi based. The player controls a spaceship which battles waves of enemies throughout the game. We decided to implement a more hectic style of gunplay where the conflict occurs through large amounts of ammunition fired from both the player and the enemies. The enemies throughout the game in the waves of attack, are on predetermined paths.The game and the whole story around it is related to the fact that the player is a guardian of the orbit around the planet Earth and should not allow invaders to enter it. In the game, the main objective is to defeat the repeated invasions by aliens which are trying to conquer the Earth. The enemies are divided into ten different in number and strength "waves". The aliens are positioned opposite the player at the top of the screen and have the ability to move and fire lasers against the player for the purpose of destruction. If a fired laser from an alien successfully hits the player, the player loses a life. If the player has no lives remaining, the game ends because the player is killed. In the event of an alien being destroyed by the player, the game will count a point, as well as any subsequent removal of an enemy. The higher the level and the points the player is, the stronger and harder it will become to kill the aliens. In the middle of the waves the player needs to defeat the deputy commander of the aliens while on the final wave the player needs to defeat the commander who leads all of the previous attacks and is the most powerful alien. Throughout the game there are several dialogs between the player and the people on Earth who report the location and number of aliens of each wave that is coming next. If the player successfully manages to kill the final boss, the game will finish with a happy end.
