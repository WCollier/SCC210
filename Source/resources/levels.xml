                Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little
                or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about
                a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
                regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
                drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
                bringing
                up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me,
                that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street,
                and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.
                This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his
                sword;
                I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in
                their degree,
                some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

                There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral
                reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward.
                Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes,
                which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

                He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great
                number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon,
                who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were
                cured,
                and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.

                Double, double toil and trouble;
                Fire burn and caldron bubble.
                Fillet of a fenny snake,
                In the caldron boil and bake;
                Eye of newt and toe of frog,
                Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
                Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
                Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
                For a charm of powerful trouble,
                Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

                Double, double toil and trouble;
                Fire burn and caldron bubble.
                Cool it with a baboon's blood,
                Then the charm is firm and good.
